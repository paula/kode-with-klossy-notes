## Kode with Klossy Notes

 Kode With Klossy Summer Camp is a free two-week summer program for girls 13 â€“ 18 years old. In classes of 20, participants learn to build real-life apps with code. The program focuses on hands-on learning through labs and projects. Scholars gain skills and proficiency in both back-end and front-end web development through building their own web apps.
